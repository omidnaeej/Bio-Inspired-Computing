## Introduction

Bio-inspired computing algorithms are a class of optimization algorithms inspired by natural processes. They are particularly useful for solving complex optimization problems that are difficult to tackle with traditional methods. This repository provides Python implementations of several popular bio-inspired algorithms, along with examples and documentation to help you get started.

## Algorithms

### Genetic Algorithms (GA)
Genetic Algorithms are inspired by the process of natural selection. They work by evolving a population of candidate solutions over several generations to find the optimal solution.

### Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)
Ant Colony Optimization is inspired by the foraging behavior of ants. It is used to solve combinatorial optimization problems by simulating the pheromone trail-laying and following behavior of ants.

### Simulated Annealing (SA)
Simulated Annealing is inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy. It is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function.

### Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
Particle Swarm Optimization is inspired by the social behavior of birds and fish. It optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality.
